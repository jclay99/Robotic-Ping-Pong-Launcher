## Background
Why is this an interesting project? What interesting problems do you need to solve to make your solution work?

Physics

## Goals

The ultimate goal of our project was to enable a Sawyer robot to locate, aim at, and launch a ping pong ball into a target container, placed a distance away from the robot. We wanted to incorporate the use of a vision tool, specifically the Sawyer right arm camera, to identify an AR tag attached to the target container, as well as calculate the ideal launch angle for the arm to launch the ping pong ball into the container.

## Applications
In what real-world robotics applications could the work from your project be useful?
