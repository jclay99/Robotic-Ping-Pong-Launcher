# Conclusion

## Discussion
Discuss your results. How well did your finished solution meet your design criteria?

## Difficulties in Implementation

The difficulties that we encountered can be separated into three distinct categories: hardware and building, physics and calculations, and code implementation.

### Hardware and Mechanics

Our project was not only an in-depth look at physics and code, but also an introduction to the world of mechanical engineering. The robot incorporated a launcher system as well as an air-pressurized gauge, and we learned very quickly about potential inaccuracies and inconsistencies that occur in mechanical engineering endeavors.

One of the first difficulties we encountered in our implementation was the inconsistency in the air pressure dispersed from the air pressure gauge. Because the air released from the tube varies based on the size of the tube, the amount of rotation on the release gauge, and the air pressure present in the containment tanks, the release velocity of the ping pong ball would greatly vary across each trial performed.

### Physics and Calculations

### Code Implementation

## Improvements
Does your solution have any flaws or hacks? What improvements would you make if you had additional time?

Despite the apparent success of the robotic ping pong ball launcher, there aspects of the project that could be improved in future iterations of this technology.
