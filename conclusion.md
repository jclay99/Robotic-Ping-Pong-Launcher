## Difficulties in Implementation

The difficulties that we encountered can be separated into three distinct categories: hardware and building, physics and calculations, and code implementation.

### Hardware and Mechanics

Our project was not only an in-depth look at physics and code, but also an introduction to the world of mechanical engineering. The robot incorporated a launcher system as well as an air-pressurized gauge, and we learned very quickly about potential inaccuracies and inconsistencies that occur in mechanical engineering endeavors.

One of the first difficulties we encountered in our implementation was the inconsistency in the air pressure dispersed from the air pressure gauge. Because the air released from the tube varies based on the size of the tube, the amount of rotation on the release gauge, and the air pressure present in the containment tanks, the release velocity of the ping pong ball would greatly vary across each trial performed.

## Improvements
Does your solution have any flaws or hacks? What improvements would you make if you had additional time?

Despite the apparent success of the robotic ping pong ball launcher, there aspects of the project that could be improved in future iterations of this technology.

### Launcher

The launcher is arguably the most important component to the project, as it is the element that launches the ball into the container and determines the efficacy of the robot. Throughout our implementation, we used a very basic design, with a cardboard tube to insert the ball, a hole to attach the air pressurized gauge to, and a cardboard tube for the ball to be launched from. We chose to use cardboard for our design because of limited expenses and easy manipulability and design adjustment. For future iterations of the launcher, the material used would ideally be PVC pipe or another more stable and solid medium.

Along this line, the air pressure gauge that we used for the implementation of our device did not have any opportunities for pressure adjustment. Ideally, the launcher would have a function allowing for adjustment of the air pressure being released from the gauge, as well as a way to control for the direction of air flow.

One final adjustment that should be made to the launcher in more improved versions of the robot would be to physically attach the launcher to the Sawyer arm. The launcher was attached to the arm using duct tape and holes in a cardboard backing attached to the tube. Because the launcher was removed and reattached every time the robot was adjusted or worked with, the trajectory of the ping pong ball as it was released from the tube was altered each time; controlling for this by attaching the launcher to the arm itself would be the most ideal situation to reconcile the need to remove the launcher with the trajectory of launch.
